Think about each module only containing errors relevant for that section?
    IE, HTTP errors only being in disnake.http.errors?

It should be intended that user only interacts with Bot, it's attributes, and objects retrieved via Bot or its
    attributes. Retrieving behavior must be reasonably swappable without breaking reasonable user code.
